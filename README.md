🔍 Overview
We modeled the humidity-dependent formation of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) from sulfur trioxide (SO₃) and water using a hybrid quantum-classical approach. The quantum part uses VQE to estimate ground-state energies, while the classical part models how relative humidity (RH) affects reaction rates.

🧬 Method Summary
Quantum Simulation of H₂O, SO₃, and H₂SO₄ using VQE

ΔE Calculation for reaction: SO₃ + nH₂O → H₂SO₄ (n = 1–3)

Reaction Rate Modeling as a function of RH (60–100%)

Visualization of RH vs. reaction rate to study climate impact

📈 Key Results
Ground-state energies:

H₂O ≈ −5.19 Ha

SO₃ ≈ −7.33 Ha

H₂SO₄ ≈ −10.99 Ha

ΔE increases with more H₂O molecules

Reaction rate increases with higher RH — supporting climate relevance
